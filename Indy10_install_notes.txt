The basic structure of the installation process for Indy10 is to first uninstall Indy7 from Delphi7 by removing it from the Delphi IDE components list by using the `Components->Install Packages` tool in Delphi7 then removing all indy components from Delphi7 Lib, Source, and Bin by hand. One can almost search for `Indy*` and `Id*` and remove the results. Caution is necessarry because there are a few IDL files which are not associated with Indy. Indy components are prefixed by "Id". 

Then unzip the Indy10 archive and run the `Fulld_7.bat` file in the Lib subdirectory of the unzipped Indy10 archive. Copy the resulting D7 folder into the Source folder of the Delphi installation. Then, use the `Component->Install Packages->Add Packages` tools to select all of the files in the D7 folder in the resulting dialogue box. Delphi may complain about missing components or being unable to find some packages, just silence those warnings, they do not affect the compilation of the file.
