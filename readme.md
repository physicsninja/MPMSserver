This is a work in progress. The goal is to modernize the QD MPMS software interface so that new users don't have to learn Delphi and can write in more modern programming languages.

# Why does this exist

Quantum Design is a pretty cool company and back in the early 2000's they deigned to allow users to use their MPMS as a PPMS by including libraries for Delphi so that one could interface with other devices and also control the MPMS. This was known as External Device Control (EDC). Delphi is in some sense a precursor to Python and this was a good choice at the time for it's relative readability and straightforward syntax.
